# EventSphere 🌐🎉

EventSphere is a Standard Web application designed for managing social events of all kinds. The platform allows unrestricted access for everyone to explore existing events and engage by leaving comments on them. Registered users, however, gain additional features such as creating new events, subscribing to events of their interest, and expressing their preference through liking 👍 or disliking 👎 events. When a user subscribes to an event, it seamlessly integrates with their personal calendar 📅.
