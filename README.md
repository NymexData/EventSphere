Eventjs

#

The project is a Standard Web application for managing social events of all kind. Everyone can access it, see and comment the existing events.
A registered user can also add new events, subscribe to existing ones and like or dislike them. When a user subscribes to an event, the event is automatically added to his/her calendar.
